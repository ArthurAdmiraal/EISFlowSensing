## Repository structure
Inside the documentation folder, you'll find the source files for images used in the documentation of the project on hackaday.io, along with the rendered versions. The source images are either vector files, or images to large to be uploaded to hackaday.io. You can also find software examples for tutorials placed on hackaday.io there.

The design folder contains CAD files and CAM files needed for replicating the project. The electrical folder contains the KiCad projects for both the electrode and signal generator PCB, along with the gerbers to get them fabricated at [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com/). The mechanical folder contains some OpenScad files for 3D-printed parts, along with STLs for the files that take a long time to render.
